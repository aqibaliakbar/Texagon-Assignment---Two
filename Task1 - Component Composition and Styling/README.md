**Task 1: React Component Composition & Styling using Chakra UI**

This repository contains the implementation for Task 1 of Texagon's React assignment, focusing on React component composition and styling using Chakra UI. Below is a summary of the task and its implementation:

**Task Description:**

- Task 1 involves creating a reusable product component using Chakra UI and demonstrating the breakdown of the UI into smaller, reusable components.
- The main objective is to showcase proficiency in component composition techniques and styling using Chakra UI.

**Implementation Overview:**

- The React application was initialized using Vite for rapid project setup.
- Two main components were created: `ProductCard` and its child component `AddToCartButton`.
- Chakra UI was exclusively used for building the components, ensuring consistency and efficiency in styling.
- Customization of Chakra UI's theme was performed to match the design requirements.
- Global styles were applied using Chakra UI's theme customization feature, enhancing the visual appeal and consistency of the components.

**Key Features:**

2. **AddToCartButton Component:**
   - A child component of `ProductCard`, showcasing the breakdown of UI into smaller, reusable components.
   - Represents a simple button component without functionality.
   - Utilizes Chakra UI components for consistent button styling.

**Usage:**

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository-url]`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd [project-directory]`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
5. Access the application in your browser at the provided address.

**Notes:**

- This implementation exclusively uses Chakra UI for component styling, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing user interface.
- Detailed documentation and instructions for this task's implementation are provided within the repository.
